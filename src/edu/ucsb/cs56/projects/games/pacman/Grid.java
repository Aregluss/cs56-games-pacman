    /* Better Implementation Idea
    You could have an ArrayList that holds Point Objects of
    locations that the Pacman has eaten pellets.
    - Create ArrayList<Point> in Grid.java & initialize
    - Add new Point every time Pacman eats pellet/fruit in PacPlayer.java

    When it is time to spawn a fruit, choose a random Point from this
    ArrayList (int) (Math.random() * list.size()), then remove the point
    where you spawned the fruit.

    When a level is complete, make sure you clear this ArrayList using
    list.clear()

    **If you want to fix this too, you can try:
    To prevent the fruit from spawning on Pacman, just cross-check
    that the spawning location != any of the Pacman location
    (use a loop on pacmen array for this so you handle multi-player mode)

    I think without having a defined search space, and just searching
    randomly, you cannot easily fix the bug where the program is looking
    forever to find an open space.  That's why having this list of possible
    spaces is the best way I can think of.
