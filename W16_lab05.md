a) A remake of the traditional Pac-Man game in Java where Pac-Man eats dots in a maze.

b) As a single-player, I can choose single player mode so that I can play a game of Pac-Man against the computer.
As a group of two players, I can choose co-op mode so that I can play a game of Pac-Man with a friend.
As a group of two players, I can choose versus mode so that I can play a game of Pac-Man against a friend.

c) The game of Pac-Man currently runs. The application opens with a menu for selecting single player, co-op, or versus mode games. Additionally, there is a high score display on the main menu. When the game starts, you can use the control keys to move the Pac-Man character.

d) As a player, I can let go of the keyboard controls so that the Pac-Man character will stop moving.
As a player, I can eat an energizer pill so that I can eat the ghosts.
As a player, I can reset the highscore list so that nobody else will have a higher score than me.

e) The state of the README file is alright. However, some facts are outdated and needs updating. Additionally, there is no documentation immediately apparent for the construction of level data other than the fact that each number in the level data array corresponds with an element of the board.

f) The current state of the build.xml file is good.

g) The current issues that exist are sufficient to earn 1000 points. However, the Create Map Data Structure issue could be further clarified to spell out what a “map editor” would entail, as a complete editor for 200 points is low.

h) // TODO - List of additional issues

i) The code is organized well however some names of classes could be further clarified. There was an initial issue with locating classes for specific functionality due to a lack of good class names.
Test coverage is extremely lacking. There are no real test cases for ensuring anything other than the leaderboard. However, as with a Pac-Man game, it is somewhat difficult to test AI movement, etc.
